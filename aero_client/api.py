    By default the source is pulled when the server receives
    ``POST /data/notify`` for it. Pass ``policy=PolicyEnum.INGESTION`` with a
    ``timer_delay`` to pull it on a schedule instead.

    Three shapes, depending on ``type_name`` and ``no_copy``:

    * **Existing type** — the url is added to it and the *same* Data UUID comes
      back. No flow is registered, so analysis flows already pointed at that UUID
      now also run when this object changes.
    * **``no_copy``** — a Data record with no flow at all. Notify records a version
      straight from the event metadata; nothing is pulled and no bytes are stored,
      and the analysis fetches the object by url.
    * **Otherwise** — an ingestion flow that pulls the object and stages it into
      the given Globus guest collection for downstream analyses to read. Driven
      by the notify webhook, or by a timer when ``policy`` says so.

    Args:
        name (str): Name for the source (becomes the Data record). On the copy
            path with a ``function_uuid``, this is **also the keyword argument
            the pulled file arrives as**, and must match both that function's
            parameter name and the ``AeroOutput(name=...)`` it returns. Without a
            verifier, or for a no-copy source, it is free-form.
        url (str): HTTPS URL of the object.
        collection_uuid (str | None): Guest collection UUID to store the file in.
            Required on the copy path only.
        collection_url (str | None): Guest collection HTTPS domain. Copy path only.
        endpoint_uuid (str | None): Globus Compute endpoint to pull on. Copy path
            only — nothing executes for a no-copy source.
        function_uuid (str | None, optional): Ingestion verify/modify wrapper. If
            omitted a raw-passthrough ``stage`` function is registered so the file
            is stored unchanged. Copy path only.
        description (str | None, optional): Description of the source.
        kwargs (JSON, optional): Extra keyword arguments for the verifier
            function, beyond the pulled file it always receives. Copy path only.
        type_name (str | None, optional): Group this url under a named type.
        no_copy (bool, optional): Track changes without copying any data.
        policy (PolicyEnum, optional): ``INGESTION_EVENT`` (the default) pulls on
            the notify webhook; ``INGESTION`` pulls on a timer. Anything else is
            rejected — those are the only two ways a source gets produced.
        timer_delay (int | None, optional): Seconds between pulls, for
            ``INGESTION``. Left unset the server's default of 86400 applies.
            Meaningless for the other paths, which run no flow of their own.

    Returns:
